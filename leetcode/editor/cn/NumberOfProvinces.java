/**
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a 
is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, 
then city a is connected indirectly with city c. 

 A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other 
cities outside of the group. 

 You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the iᵗ
ʰ city and the jᵗʰ city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 
otherwise. 

 Return the total number of provinces. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= n <= 200 
 n == isConnected.length 
 n == isConnected[i].length 
 isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0. 
 isConnected[i][i] == 1 
 isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
