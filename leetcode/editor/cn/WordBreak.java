/**
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be 
segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. 

 Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the 
segmentation. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen 
apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= s.length <= 300 
 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000 
 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20 
 s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters. 
 All the strings of wordDict are unique.
